**Why this anime should watched by developer?**

It does not have any hackers or programmers, but think most techies will be able to relate with the energy-conserving, apathetic protagonist, Oreki Houtarou. Also, the way he uses logical reasoning to solve any mystery that comes up is fascinating to watch.
